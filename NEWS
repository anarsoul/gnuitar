Version 0.6.0
Effects:
- Distortion 2 reworked and renamed to Overdrive;
- Tuner with layouts (6-string guitar, 4-str. bass etc; easily extendable)
- pitch shift effect;
- built-in bias elimination and noise reduction;
- reworked much more realistic echo;
- reworked chorus - changed controls;
- reworked phaser - the previous effect was actually a wah modification rather
  than phaser;
- tremolo and vibrato names swapped;
- tremolo algo changed;
- reworked auto-wah with two modes -- sweep constantly,
  or sweep only the note playing;
- tubeamp effect -- it picks up the things where the overdrive had left it;
- simple amp effect;
- rotary speaker effect;
Internals:
- ALSA support;
- JACK support;
- added infrastructure to support multiple sound drivers. Currently supported
  ones are OSS, ALSA (*NIX), MMSystem, DirectSound (Win32).
- added background for building stereo/quadro effects;
- added background for having different number of input and output channels,
  if the audio driver supports such;
- unified lookup tables (previously there were many ways of calculating sin() -
  via lookup table, and via math.h's sin());
- unified "backbuf" memory storage for memory based effects (echo, delay etc)
- many misc. improvements in effects;
Interface:
- simple vU meter (based on GTK progress bar);
- simple input and output volume control;
- added configuration .ini-style file in home directory .gnuitarrc;
- presets are stored in text .ini-style format;
- effect windows can be closed by clicking on [x] icon and thus removed
  from active effects list (more intuitive than before);
- save track to .wav on *NIX using libsndfile library;
- suggest a date/time-based filename when writing a track;
Misc:
- added some optimizations on Intel systems -- gcc -msse{1|2|3};
- simplistic debian package;
