0.3.0
+ DirectSound API Win32
  + fix buffer over/underruns (48000)
  + fix latency autowah
  + DirectSound control in sampling params dialog
  + optimize loops in the audio thread

0.3.1
+ noise gate
+ new overdrive effect

0.3.2
+ GTK2
  - test on Windows
+ equalizer effect
  + 5kHz limit problem
+ process all in floats to decrease SNR ? Convert only on input and output ?
  (as IFDEF)
+ distortion
+ correct build files for MSVC6.0
+ help contents on Windows 2000
+ sigfault on help contents with netscape, linux
  (looks like it is a netscape own error)
+ review the docs, especially build notes for the console MSVC users
+ check autowah on windows
+ better presets for distort1 and phasor
+ autowah breaks the updated low and high values

0.3.3 bugfix release
NOTE - this release will not be. All goals are reached; we're working now
on 0.4.0 or maybe even 0.5.0.
+ The EQ bank remembers the values, but they are most definitely not applied to 
  the sound. (You can recreate this by having an EQ bank with harsh EQ 
  settings, saving the layout, quitting/reloading this layout, then you will 
  hear the the effect is not applied. If the slider parameter is adjusted, then 
  that particular EQ band then works again.)
+ A simple volume effect would be useful. The 2nd distortion effect is great but 
  sometimes I find it increases the volume to the point where clipping starts 
  to occur. When this happens, I currently have to use the volume of an EQ bank 
  to reduce the volume to get rid of the clipping. A simple volume effect would 
  work great here.
+ Another feature which might be useful, would be a .gnuitar folder within the 
  home area?? which remembers the options settings eg latency, and reloads 
  these settings next time Gnuitar is run.
  + GTK1.2
+ Debian package
+ Race condition on windows: START/STOP can mess up the audio thread.

0.5.0
0.6.0
Autowah:
- I more liked the initial version of the effect. I miss the old 
power of the effect, it was more bright; I cannot achieve the 
same sound with the current version. I'm wondering are there 
presets which make your algo sound like the older one ?

Tremolo:
- does not sound like it was before. I do not see the recent 
changes but I think it was more bright before. Currently it 
sounds more like vibrato.

Reverb:
- I more liked the reverb which was in the very first versions of 
the program. It allowed me to sound like Another Brick in the 
Wall part 1 -- large number and volume of repeats, currently it 
is impossible.

Phaser:
- I hear no effect at all. How it should sound ?

Rotary speaker:
- no effect. I hear nothing. I know it is stereo, I tried in both 
mono and stereo input modes.

- ALSA is still broken on my laptop - 2Antti
- fix version and copyrights in about dialog; maybe create a tabbed window
  with sections "authors", "license" etc. - 2Vasily
- problems with mms driver on windows - 2Fonin
- tubeamp and rotary do not work under win32 (as Vasily reported) - 2Antti
- mentioned bug with sound skips during the track recording, when 
  the system does the blocking syscalls - 2everyone who can fix it
+ Separate driver routines for DirectX
  - fix directsound high latency
- thoroughly test the program; make sure there are no critical bugs - 2All
- update docs - 2Fonin
- create a script to produce README file from .html source (?)
+ JACK-audio-connection support
+ Distortion 2 effect values are reset when a layout is loaded.
+ Fix track filename on windows
+ tuner
  + draw a nice guitar tab and highlight the string as we match its freq.
    Currently the tuner scale is a bit ugly.
  + decrease the accuracy - the leds never light
+ GTK-compat for gkeyfile
+ add a button to remove preset from a list
+ weird values in "bits" dropdown
+ constraints for fragment size for various audio drivers (2^N for OSS etc)
+ remove mix control from autowah, or replace it with dry/wet
+ tooltips to the noise gate window with important notes
+ double click on effect's name put a focus on its window
+ master volume is saved in the preset

0.7.0
- asio support on Windows
- get rid of the console window; split an area in the main window for the status
  messages;
- Split off DirectX stuff into a separate file - audio-dsound.*
- load preset files from the command line
- group effects and give it meaningful names (like overdrive should be together;
  delay effects should be together; etc)
- new noise gate effect
- i18n
- effects with a sinusoidal phase/amplitude shape (tremolo,chorus)
  offer other shapes (square, triangular)
- fix non-ASCII filenames with GTK file dialogs
?- external pedal and switch
- play .wav in the background

Ongoing bugs (misc):
- convert the names of presets to UTF8 strings, before append it
  to the bank list, as recommended by GTK-Win32 manual.
- bug with GTK critical error on finish

Misc something:
- port to wxWidgets ?
- have a text boxes connected to the sliders, to directly edit the values
- how to swap a slider controls, to make a bottom be on top and vice versa ?
  So we move the slider up to increase the value, instead of moving it down...
