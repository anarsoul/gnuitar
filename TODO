For 0.1.0 Release
- extensively testing to find security issues, memory leaks etc.
- about box and logo
- documentation
- push effects on the _top_ of stack

For future releases:
+ tracker
  - gzip track file on the fly
  - improve quality (now it writes sound with cutoff frequencies)
- allow to control the sampling rate and buffer size (now it's hard-coded)
- equalizer
- noise redution as separate effect
- think about plugins
