Q: It seems GNUitar works, but I can't hear effects applied 
   to my guitar sound. "Pure" sound of the guitar is send to the speakers,
   but with no applied effects. I hear native effects' noise, and it 
   seems like there is zero input signal send to effects.
A: Make sure your line input or microphone input levels is not muted.
   Use regular mixer program to adjust input levels.

Q: GNUitar noises terribly !
A: You should adjust your mixer properly. Set the line input to maximum level,
   wave out and master volume to middle level, and then start to decrease
   master volume until the noise will become minimal. Increase volume
   on your external amplifier.
   The reason of problem is that most soundcards have bad signal/noise ratio
   in full-duplex mode.
