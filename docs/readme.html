          <strong>GNUitar</strong> &mdash; a free guitar processor software
</h1>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 2em">By Max Rudensky, Ciulei Bogdan, Antti S. Lankila and Vasily Khoruzhick</p>
<h1><a name=about>Introduction</a></h1>

<p>
    GNUitar is a cross-platform real-time sound effects software that allows 
    you to use your computer as a low-latency effect processor. It has GTK+ based 
    interface. It can be compiled on any flavor of Unix that has
    GTK+ 1.2, 2.x, pthreads and JACK, ALSA or OSS sound drivers.
    Windows version can be compiled with MinGW and MS Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
    GNUitar contains all typical guitar effects, including chorus, phaser, tube amp
    simulation, overdrive distortion, wah, reverb, etc. Additionally,
    GNUitar supports MIDI devices for switching between effect presets and
    wah control. One device tested and known to work is Roland's FC-200.
    Wah center frequency can be controlled through any pitch bend control or
    any variable controller. (MIDI support is currently Linux ALSA/JACK only.)
</p>

<p>
    GNUitar is pronounced like "GNU Guitar". English was not the author's native
    language. When he invented the word, it didn't occur for him to think how
    it should be pronounced.
</p>
<p>GNUitar is distributed under GNU GPL.</p>

<h1><a name=requirements>Requirements</a></h1>

<p>To run the software:</p>
<ul>
<li>GTK+ versions 1.2.6 or better, or GTK+ 2.6 or better</li>
<li>GLIB 1.2 or better</li>
<li>POSIX threads on UNIX</li>
<li>full-duplex sound card</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>To compile the software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unix: GCC on Unixish systems</li>
<li>Windows: MinGW and MSYS, or Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or 7.0</li>
<li>Both: fftw3 for some FFT algorithms (optional)</li>
<li>Windows: DirectX SDK (or get a copy of dsound.h from WINE)</li>
<li>Unix: sndfile for wav output on Unixish systems<li>
<li>Unix: jack, libasound</li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment, GNUitar contains autotools, Visual Studio and CMake build system
   files. Using CMake is the recommended way to build GNUitar, but autotools should
   work on Linux at least.</p>

<h1><a name=performance>Performance</a></h1>

<p>GNUitar should run on even low-end hardware. It has been reported to work
on even a Pentium II / 300 MHz computer. However, some of the effects
demand more CPU power, and probably at least 1 GHz machine is required for
running complicated effect setups.
</p>
<p>
At the moment GNUitar is not capable of utilising dual-core systems for effect processing.
This is because the effect pipeline runs on one thread and the data must pass quickly
from one effect to next. Utilising dual-core would require independent parts of pipeline
that could be run in parallel, but on GNUitar all effects are daisy-chained. That being
said, the dual-core will still be used to run the GUI thread, and a version of JACK
exists that attempts to use multiple cores to run the independent parts of audio chain
simultaneously.
</p>

<p>GNUitar places itself on elevated priority for the time-critical audio thread.
When running the program, make sure you close all unnecessary applications,
to free more resources. You would do well to avoid anything that can cause disk
activity or unpredictable bursts of CPU usage.</p>

<p>
<strong style="color:red">Warning:</strong> System hang-ups may happen if the effect
chain ends up consuming all CPU <strong>making the computer unusable</strong>.
Therefore you should take care to save all important data in other applications before
testing the limits of GNUitar.
</p>

<h2><a name=perf_unix>Performance on UNIX</a></h2>

<p>GNUitar executable file should be setuid root to process sound using
real-time priority class; otherwise you'll hear glitches and delays while 
switching between windows. The program drops privileges after setting realtime
class, before analysing any user input. We belive it is secure.
Latencies of between 4-8 ms are readily obtained on even modest hardware.
</p>
<h3>Audio driver setup guide</h3>
<p>
    Plug something into your line input jack: guitar, portable CD player,
    whatever.  If you have "Analog Mix" control, you can test sound input
    without running GNUitar.  Temporarily maximise the "Analog Mix" control and
    twiddle with capture controls until you start to hear something. After
    this, mute every unnecessary capture control. You should end up with the minimum
    set of mixers necessary to get the input into the soundcard's output.
    When done, turn "Analog Mix" control down. No sound must be produced if
    GNUitar is not running.
</p>
<p>
    Typical setup that works is: Line input is maximised, Analog Mix is minimised,
    Analog Mix Capture is maximised. <strong color="red:">Important:</strong>
    ensure that the "What You Hear" control, often called PCM capture on ALSA, is muted.
    If this control is maximised, gnuitar will constantly reprocess its own output.
</p>
<p>
    Be sure to turn your volume low before starting GNUitar for the first time.
    Your speakers and your ears will thank you. Observe the input volume and master
    volume VU meters. You should be reading some value above -96 on them, and the
    bars should wiggle a bit, as indication that some signal is coming in.
    The scale is logarithmic, so even the slightest noise can be seen.
</p>
<p>
    On the other
    hand, if the bars are at -96 and there is a large button on left that says "ERROR",
    the sound driver could not be initialised and the debug window on bottom should be
    examined for clues about the setup failure. Try different drivers, for instance
    JACK or ALSA from the sampling parameters dialog in Options menu. Press the "ERROR"
    button to try setting audio up again. If it works now, the button changes to Stop
    and remains pressed down.
</p>
<p>
    To set up appropriate volume on capture and playback, you should choose the Line In
    or Analog Mix Capture control value in such a way that the maximum sound is
    is not hitting above the -3 dB value on either control. After -3 dB, the sound will
    almost certainly begin to distort. This can be heard as a harsh "edge" appearing
    on sound. This distortion contains <strong>significant</strong> amount of energy
    in treble range and may <strong>easily destroy your speakers</strong>, so please be
    cautious! If you want distorted sounds, try using the tube-amp and overdrive effects.
</p>
<p>
    The volume sliders to right of VUs are digital volume controls, and do not
    change mixer settings. Using these to correct for the problem may be
    appropriate for output after effect processing has occured, but is rarely good
    idea for input because of the implied loss in dynamic range. When picking a
    chord normally, the input VU should indicate volume somewhere between
    -10 and -20 dB.
</p>

<h3>JACK setup tips</h3>

<p>JACK parameters are defined in a file called .jackdrc on home directory.
    When GNUitar starts, it tries to contact a JACK server or opens up its own if
    none exist, and these parameters are used.  This line works quite well on Ubuntu
    Dapper/Edgy:
</p>
<pre>/usr/bin/jackstart -R -dalsa -dhw:0 -r48000 -p256 -n2 -i2 -o2 -zs</pre>
<p>
    It specifies realtime (elevated priority) operation, alsa driver using alsa
    hardware hw:0, 48000 Hz sampling frequency, 256-frame buffer size (quite large,
    also 128 would work well), 2 periods, 2 input channels, 2 output channels
    and shaped dither mode.
</p>
<p>
    48000 Hz sampling frequency is recommended if Creative soundcards are used,
    because they only work correctly on this sampling frequency (at least on Linux).
    In fact, Creative soundcards have long been an enemy of hi-fi audio
    reproduction. It doesn't matter whether Creative's design is to blame or whether
    it is due to bugs on Linux driver: the end result is same. Regardless, M-Audio
    soundcards should be an excellent alternative for Linux at the moment (2006).
</p>
<p>
    Audio dithering may be waste for sampled audio which is usually noisy to begin with,
    but shaped dithering offers some dynamic range extension between 0-12 kHz with the
    cost of added noise between 12 and 24 kHz. The dithering algorithm used by JACK
    is fast enough, so I recommend using it. The audio is dithered with all other
    drivers by GNUitar, but with JACK it is assumed that JACK is setup to do its own
    dithering.
</p>
<p>
    For MIDI, some kind of JACK connection utility is necessary for making the
    connection from your MIDI device of choice to GNUitar's midi port. If you do not have
    hardware MIDI devices that you wish to use with gnuitar, you of course do not
    need to do this. I use qjackctl for JACK configuration and connection management.
</p>

<h2><a name=perf_windows>Performance on Windows</a></h2>

<p>Windows have complex problems with latency when processing audio in real time,
mostly because of its non-uniform drivers architecture. 
GNUitar latency on Windows is much higher than on Linux. The real latency
depends mostly on the sound card's driver.
</p>

<p>GNUitar for Windows has two playback methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playback via MMSystem</li>
<li>Playback via DirectSound</li>
</ul>
<p>The first method uses the standard MME API (functions waveOut*()).
The second method requires DirectX to be installed and uses DirectSound
for playback. The method can be switched from the sampling parameters dialog,
by checking/unchecking the "Playback via DirectSound" checkbox.
</p>
<p>DirectSound playback shows the best results that are almost close to
Linux performance. The MME playback exists for compatibility purposes,
and for another reason. If a driver is not optimized for DirectSound,
Windows will automatically emulate DirectSound output using the MME devices.
If a WDM driver is used (see below), DirectSound support is not implemented
by the driver developer but by the operating system. MME playback support exists
specially for this case, when the output via DirectSound is emulated by OS.
</p>
<h3>Windows Sound Drivers Overview</h3>
<p>There are few kinds of sound drivers for Windows: old VXD (Win95/98),
NT4-kernel style, and modern WDM drivers that were introduced in Windows 98/SE.
AFAIK WDM drivers provide much lower latency. Therefore, avoid VXD drivers; 
use modern WDM drivers instead, if possible.
</p>
<p>The difference in latency between two kinds of drivers is really noticeable:
I had 100ms up to ~400ms on Pentium III/850/ISA AWE64/VXD/MME playback,
and ~60ms on Pentium MMX/166/Yamaha OPL3/WDM/MME playback laptop.
Try to start/stop sound few times, if the initial latency is bad.
</p>
<p>The kind of bus (PCI Express/PCI/ISA) of the sound card does not affect
the latency that much, it's most often a software issue. Old sound cards that
are unusable in Windows are likely to work just fine in Linux.
</p>

<h1><a name=latency_control>How To Control Latency</h1>
<p>The latency can be controlled in the Options dialog.
It can be invoked from the
<i>Options->Sampling Parameters</i> menu (or by <i>Ctrl-P</i>). You will
need to stop playback before this dialog is available. (Will be fixed in
a future release.) There is an option called "Fragment Size". The lower the
fragment size is, the better is the latency, but this is not a free lunch.
If the latency is too low, the CPU must be constantly working with the audio
driver, and any pause in audio processing will cause an overrun.
You may need to increase the fragment size on low-end computers. Try increasing
this value if you hear repeated scratching or popping from the speakers.
</p>
<p>General notes on how to achieve the best performance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower the sampling rate, the less there is CPU load. Drawback is
the lower sound quality.</li>
<li>The lower the fragment size, the better is the latency. Drawback is the
higher system load.</li>
<li>The audible periodic scratches (DirectX output) can be fixed
by decreasing the overrun threshold (sampling parameters dialog).</li>
<li>Increase the fragment size and decrease the sampling rate on
low-end CPU, to gain the best latency/overruns/load ratio.</li>
<li>On Windows, prefer WDM drivers, if possible. Try both MMSystem and
DirectX playback; choose which is the best.</li>
<li>Prefer Linux over Windows. Properly tuned Linux kernel has 10-100 times 
better latency on the same hardware.</li>
<li>Make GNUitar executable setuid root on UNIX, to allow it run with
increased priority. (See discussion about security on Performance section above.)</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name=install>Installation</a></h1>

<p>
See <a href=install.html>INSTALL</a> file for common installation notes.
</p>

<h1><a name=gui>Interface and Controls</a></h1>

<p>There are 3 areas in the main window. The right area is a list of all
available effects. The central area contains effects that are currently used.
There are few buttons right to it should be used to add/remove effects 
and change its order. Each effect has separate top-level control window with 
appropriate sliders.  Each effect-control box is shown in the window manager
task bar.
</p>

<p>The left area contains available effect layouts, or presets, and button
to add the one. Layout is a "snapshot" of your effects and its' 
settings, you can load/save using "File" menu.
</p>

<p>Big "Cycle button" button is used to cycle between layouts. In this manner,
you can change current sound by one mouse/keyboard click.
</p>

<p>Big "START/STOP" button is used to start/stop playback.
You may want to try pressing it a few times if you experience buffer overruns
or broken sound output. Sometimes it helps.
</p>

<p>You can write track of what you play to a file. Just click
check-box "Write track" at the bottom of program window, enter 
file name and play. Don't forget that continuous track write 
can fill out your hard drive.
The track file format is WAV data on Windows and Linux.
</p>
<p>Linux WAV writing depends on libsndfile. However, if you do not have sndfile,
then the data is raw 16-bit signed data on host system endianness, with the sampling rate
and channels as defined in the sampling parameters dialog. You can convert it with
<a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a> like this:
</p>
<pre>sox -w -s -c 1 -r 44100 track.raw track.wav,</pre>
<p>
and then to <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">ogg vorbis</a>:
</p>
<pre>oggenc track.wav</pre>

<h1><a name=effects>Effects</a></h1>
<p>
The controls and description of the effects follow below.
</p>
<h2><a name=autowah>Autowah</a></h2>
<p>
    Wah sound is typically implemented by a resonant filter. GNUitar provides three
    resonant filters to play with: low-pass filter, 2x rc bandpass filter and a
    digital model of the moog ladder filter (in-between low-pass and bandpass resonant
    filters but also nonlinear, causing sound "warming" or "dirtying").
</p>
<p>
    The moog filter model was designed by Antti Huovilainen, and it was published at
    DAFx'04. On low resonance values it acts a lot like a 2nd order bandpass filter with
    some saturation colouring the sound into a warmer, bloomy sound. On resonance values
    exceeding 100%, the wah would actually produce self-supporting oscillations, turning
    into a synthesizer itself.

    Values close and exceeding 100% are slightly dangerous and may clip. Adjust volume
    down if extreme resonances are desired.</dd>
<dt>sweep mode</dt>
<dd>The Wah can be run in three modes. The continuous mode simply sweeps between the
    low and high frequency range in /\/\/\/ type manner, the envelope mode attempts to
    "listens" to input signal and trigger wah sweep from high to low frequency whenever
    guitar is being picked. The third mode uses a MIDI pitch bend control to set the
    wah frequency.</dd>

<h2><a name=delay>Delay</a></h2>

<h2><a name=reverb>Reverberator</a></h2>

</dl>

<h2><a name=tremolo>Tremolo</a></h2>
<p>
Tremolo is a pitch shifter that does not preserve note relationships (in other words,
a bit like a genuine tremolo bar). This effect is really a version of Stereo phaser
with Wet at 100 % and only one channel used for output.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>period</dt><dd>length of one cycle of effect</dd>
<dt>amplitude</dt><dd>depth of modulation</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=chorus>Chorus / Flanger</a></h2>
<p>
This effect mixes a time-delayed versions of input with the original signal
simulating several players playing the same tune. Variations of this
concept also produce flanger and vibrato effects.
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>Use several voices and long base delay time.</p>
<p><strong>Flanger</strong>With just 1 voice and low delay time, the effect becomes a
flanger. However, by adding more voices and increasing the delay, the sound again
turns choruslike. If the multichannel mode is available and enabled, the effect
distributes one voice per output channel.
</p>
<p><strong>Vibrato</strong> If dry/wet at 100% (fully wet) and 1 voice, this effect
becomes a vibrato.

</dl>

<h2><a name=echo>Echo</a></h2>

<p>
Another reverberation effect, but not like the others.  Echo simulates a
large hall echo using varying length of delays in all its voices, and produces
complicated echo pattern that simulates large hall full of hard surfaces of different
sizes.
</p>

</dl>

<h2><a name=phaser>Phaser</a></h2>

<p>
Phaser operates by introducing a variable frequency dependant delay over the audio
signal. If the dry/wet ratio is at 50 %, the delayed components will produce interference
with the original signal which produces moving notches across the audio spectrum,
producing the phaser sound. However, if dry/wet ratio is at 100%, this effect becomes 
a vibrato.

<dt>stereo</dt>
<dd>Stereo switch changes the algorithm to one based on hilbert transform, which
    naturally produces signals with time-varying phase shift.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=rotary>Rotary speaker</a></h2>

<p>
Rotary speaker is an implementation of the combined horn and bass speaker mounted on
opposite sides of a rotating cabinet. As the cabinet turns, the doppler effect shifts
the audio spectrum up and down, depending on whether the speaker is receding or
approaching.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>period</dt>
<dd>Time for one complete rotation of the cabinet.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=tremolobar>Tremolo bar</a></h2>
<p>
Does a pitch shift using single sideband modulation that does not preserve
harmonious relationships, causing the guitar to appear out of tune at first.
Larger displacement of tone produce metal bell -type sounds as the harmonic
components shift into relationships that are not possible for a guitar to make.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>period</dt>

<dt>base</dt>
<dd>fixed amount of pitch shift. If this value is 0 or less, the sideband modulation
occurs downwards. If the value is greater than 0, the switch occurs upwards</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=distort2>Overdrive</a></h2>

<p>Another cool distortion. Emulates the distortion circuits in many popular
overdrive pedals such as Ibanez TS9.

</dl>

<h2><a name=tubeamp>Tube amplifier</a></h2>

<p>
Because Overdrive is limited to simulating the Ibanez TS9, another effect is required
for more powerful distortion sounds.
The effect loosely models a tube amplifier with a variable number of output stages,
each which add slightly different kind of clipping to the sound.
</p>

<dl>

<dd>Number of stages. All can be used to produce distortion, 3-4 stages being very close
to overkill.</dd>

<dt>dynamic bias</dt>
<dd>Input-dependant parameter to the ad-hoc tube model.</dd>

<h2><a name=noise>Noise gate</a></h2>

<p>Simple noise reduction effect.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT NOTES</h3>

<ul>
<li>Should be used <b>BEFORE</b> the distortion.</li>
<li>If you want to achieve a note slight attack (fade in),
    you must increase the Hold time as much as possible.
    Otherwise with the low Attack time and low signal you
    the effect will be constantly false triggered, therefore
    breaking the fade-in effect</li>
</ul>

<p>Controls are:</p>
<ul>
<li>threshold    - minimal volume of the sound required to pass signal
                   to the output.</li>
<li>hold         - if the signal is below threshold during this time,
                   it will be muted. Should be as low as possible.
		   Simply - it is an effect triggering time.</li>
<li>release time - if the signal is below threshold, the playback
                   is not muted immediately but fades out this time instead</li>
<li>attack       - if the signal is above the threshold, it will fade in
                   this time. Usually should be 0, but having it
		   non-zero will produce interesting effect just like the
		   violin sound.</li>
<li>hysteresis   - the threshold required to turn off the playback when
                   it is already on (the regular threshold affects
		   only the growing signal, while hysteresis
		   affects fading signal). Should not be made larger than
		   the threshold value.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="eqbank">Equalizer bank</a></h2>

<p>
A no-frills equalizer effect with plenty of sliders for fine grained
control of the frequency response. Equalizers are rumoured to be especially
useful before and after distortion effects.
</p>

<h2><a name=pitch>Pitch shifter</a></h2>

<p>Pitch shifter is a stock WSOLA (Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add) algorithm.
Waveform similarity looks at repeating waveform shapes and then does some
"cut and paste" to build lengthened or shortened version of the original waveform
without affecting the sound pitch.  The effect first lengthens or shortens the
play length of the sound without, then resamples the audio to the desired playback
rate, causing the actual pitch shift effect.

<p>This pitch shifter is not suitable for general music rekeying, but should be
suitable for simple instruments such as human voice or guitar. Complex
polyharmonic sounds combine to a complicated waveform, making it difficult to
find an appropriate "copy" of the input signal for duplication. This condition
shows as frequency wavering effects and pre-echo type of artifacts. Secondly, the
effect processes all inputs channels independently, leading to phase errors in
stereo music.</p>

<h2><a name=tuner>Tuner</a></h2>

<p>
This is a simple general-purpose instrument tuner. The display contains:
</p>

<ul>

<b>How to tune</b>

<p>In nutshell: if the indicator veers to left, tune up; if it veers to right, tune down.</p>

<p>
Tuner is generally agnostic to the desired tuning. Some indicators are provided
that match some of the most typical guitar tunings, but whether you use them
or not is up to you.

<b>Tricks and tips</b>

<p> Tuner is very sensitive to noise (unfortunately), so a good, clean signal
is the most important thing.  If tuner doesn't quite seem to work for you out
of the box, try the following tricks: </p>

<ul>
<li>
    Mute all other strings <em>lightly</em> with your fingers. Don't press
    or bend the strings, if you have a floating bridge&mdash;this will
    have similar effect as pressing tremolo bar down.
</li>
<li>
    Pick the string normally above the pickups. The tuner tends to find the
    frequency component with the most amplitude. If you pick the strings in an unusual
    way, it may find some high-order harmonics instead (or even worse,
    oscillate between some upper harmonic and the base frequency).
</li>
<li>
    Try different pickups if tuner has difficulties with particular pickups.
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use the tuner to fix your guitar's intonation (the length of
the string). You may need to check intonation whenever you change your string
make or gauge. First, tune your guitar as perfectly as possible, then pick all
the strings at the 12th fret.  You should see the tuner report double the
frequency but the accuracy indicator should stay centered. Compare this
frequency with the harmonic 12th frequency -- they should be the same.
However, if the indicator of fretted 12th is right to the harmonic, you need to
make the string longer. If it is to left, you need to make the string shorter.
As a general guideline, the thinnest strings are the shortest, and the thickest
strings the longest.</p>
