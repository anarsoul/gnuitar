<h1><a name=about>What is GNUitar ?</a></h1>

<p>GNUitar is a real-time sound effects software that allows 
you to use your computer as a guitar processor. It has GTK+ based 
interface. It can be compiled on any flavor of UNIX that have
GTK+ 1.2, 2.0, Glib, pthreads and OSS sound driver. It also works on Windows.
This program was inspired by two earlier works:<ul>
<li>Ele 0.1 by Morris Slutsky<br>

</ul>
GNUitar is free software and is distributed under GNU GPL license.
</p>

<p>GNUitar is pronounced like "GNU Guitar". English is not my native language,
so when I invented this word I did not think how it should be pronounced.
Unless someone has a better idea, let's pronounce it like this for now.

<h1><a name=requirements>Requirements</a></h1>

<p>You will need:<ul>
<li>GTK+ versions 1.2.6 or better, or GTK+ 2.0 or better</li>
<li>GLIB 1.2 or better</li>
<li>POSIX threads on UNIX</li>
<li>full-duplex sound card</li>
<li>To compile: GCC on UNIX, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or 7.0 on Windows</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name=performance>Performance</a></h1>

<p>GNUitar should run on even low-end hardware. It has been reported to work
on even a Pentium II / 300 MHz computer. However, some of the effects
demand more CPU power, and probably ~1 GHz machine is required for
running complicated effect setups.
</p>

<p>When running the program, make sure you close all unnecessary applications,
to free more resources. Avoid anything that can cause lots of disk I/O
or sudden bursts of CPU usage.</p>

<p>
GNUitar runs with increased priority if available; this may cause hang-ups
and delayed system response on low-end machines <strong>potentially making the
computer unusable</strong>. Therefore you should take care to save all
important data in other applications before launching GNUitar.
This situation probably does not occur in practice, but with elevated task
priorities the consequences for misbehaviour become greater.
</p>

<h2><a name=perf_unix>Performance - UNIX notes</a></h2>

<p>GNUitar executable file should be setuid root to process sound using
real-time priority class; otherwise you'll hear glitches and delays while 
switching between windows. The program drops privileges as soon as the
effect-processing thread has been started, even before any GTK+ initialization
or command line handling, so it should be safe on any system.
GNUitar has a latency of about 4-8ms on Linux/Pentium II/450/AWE64 ISA!
</p>

<h2><a name=perf_windows>Performance - Windows notes</a></h2>

<p>Windows have complex problems with latency when processing audio in real time,
mostly because of its non-uniform drivers architecture. 
GNUitar latency on Windows is much higher than on Linux. The real latency
depends mostly on the sound card's driver.
</p>

<p>GNUitar for Windows has two playback methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playback via MME</li>
<li>Playback via DirectSound</li>
</ul>
<p>The first method uses the standard MME API (functions waveOut*()).
The second method requires DirectX to be installed and uses DirectSound
for playback. The method can be switched from the sampling parameters dialog,
by checking/unchecking the "Playback via DirectSound" checkbox.
</p>
<p>DirectSound playback shows the best results that are almost close to
Linux performance. The MME playback exists for compatibility purposes,
and for another reason. If a driver is not optimized for DirectSound,
Windows will automatically emulate DirectSound output using the MME devices.
If a WDM driver is used (see below), DirectSound support is not implemented
by the driver developer but by the operating system. MME playback support exists
specially for this case, when the output via DirectSound is emulated by OS.
</p>
<h3>Windows Sound Drivers Overview</h3>
<p>There are few kinds of sound drivers for Windows: old VXD (Win95/98),
NT4-kernel style, and modern WDM drivers that were introduced in Windows 98/SE.
AFAIK WDM drivers provide much lower latency. Therefore, avoid VXD drivers; 
use modern WDM drivers instead, if possible.
</p>
<p>The difference in latency between two kinds of drivers is really noticeable:
I had 100ms up to ~400ms on Pentium III/850/ISA AWE64/VXD/MME playback,
and ~60ms on Pentium MMX/166/Yamaha OPL3/WDM/MME playback laptop.
Try to start/stop sound few times, if the initial latency is bad.
</p>
<p>The kind of bus (PCI Express/PCI/ISA) of the sound card does not affect
the latency that much, it's most often a software issue. Old sound cards that
are unusable in Windows are likely to work just fine in Linux.
</p>

<h2><a name=latency_control>How To Control Latency</h2>
<p>The latency can be controlled to a high degree in the Options dialog.
It can be invoked from the
<i>Options->Sampling Parameters</i> menu (or by <i>Ctrl-P</i>). You will
need to stop playback before entering this dialog.
There is an option called "Fragment Size". The lower the fragment size is,
the better is the latency, but this is not a free lunch. If the latency
is too low, the CPU drain from constantly attending to the sound card
leaves no time for anything else! You may need to increase the
fragment size on low-end computers. Try increasing this value if you hear
repeated scratches from the speakers.
</p>
<p>General notes on how to achieve the best performance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower the sampling rate, the less there is CPU load. Drawback is
the lower sound quality.</li>
<li>The lower the fragment size, the better is the latency. Drawback is the
higher system load.</li>
<li>The audible periodic scratches (DirectSound output) can be fixed
by decreasing the overrun threshold (sampling parameters dialog).</li>
<li>Increase the fragment size and decrease the sampling rate on
low-end CPU, to gain the best latency/overruns/load ratio.</li>
<li>On Windows, prefer WDM drivers, if possible. Try both MME and
DirectSound playback; choose which is the best.</li>
<li>Prefer Linux over Windows. Properly tuned Linux kernel has 10-100 times 
better latency on the same hardware.</li>
<li>Make gnuitar executable setuid root on UNIX, to allow it run with
increased priority.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name=install>Installation</a></h1>

<p>
See <a href=install.html>INSTALL</a> file for common installation notes.
</p>

<h1><a name=gui>Interface and Controls</a></h1>

<p>There are 3 areas in the main window. The right area is a list of all
available effects. The central area contains effects that are currently used.
There are few buttons right to it should be used to add/remove effects 
and change its order. Each effect has separate top-level control window with 
appropriate sliders.  Each effect-control box is shown in the window manager
task bar.
</p>

<p>The left area contains available effect layouts, or presets, and button
to add the one. Layout is a "snapshot" of your effects and its' 
settings, you can load/save using "File" menu.
</p>

<p>Big "Switch" button is used to switch layouts. In this manner,
you can change current sound by one mouse/keyboard click.
</p>

<p>Big "START/STOP" button is used to start/stop playback.
You may want to try pressing it a few times if you experience buffer overruns
or broken sound output.
</p>

<p>You can write track of what you play to a file. Just click
check-box "Write track" at the bottom of program window, enter 
file name and play. Don't forget that continuous track write 
can fill out your hard drive.
The track file format is WAV data on Windows and Linux.
</p>
<p>Linux WAV writing depends on libsndfile. However, if you do not have sndfile, then the data is raw 16-bit signed data, with the sampling rate and channels
as defined in the sampling parameters dialog. You can convert it with <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a> like this:
</p>
<pre>
    sox -w -s -c 1 -r 44100 track.raw track.wav, 
</pre>
<p>
and then to <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">ogg vorbis</a>:
</p>
<pre>
    oggenc track.wav
</pre>

<h1><a name=effects>Effects</a></h1>
<p>
The controls and description of the effects follow below.
</p>
<h2><a name=autowah>Autowah</a></h2>
<p>
    The autowah is implemented using a digital model of the moog ladder filter.
    The model was designed by Antti Huovilainen, and it was published at DAFx'04.
    On low resonance values it acts a lot like a 2nd order bandpass filter with some
    saturation colouring the sound into a warm, bloomy sound. On high resonance
    values, the wah becomes a sound synthesizer itself.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>period</dt>
<dd>length of one cycle of effect</dd>
<dt>low freq</dt>
<dd>lowest frequency (the cycle ends at this freq.)</dd>
<dt>high freq</dt>
<dd>high frequency (the cycle starts at this freq.)</dd>
<dt>dry/wet</dt>
<dd>mix clean sound with processed sound</dd>
<dt>resonance</dt>
<dd>choose resonance of the moog ladder filter.
    Values above 110 % lead to self-supporting oscillations.</dd>
<dt>continuous sweep</dt>
<dd>The Wah can be run in two modes, one where it sweeps between the low and high
    frequency in /\/\/\/ type manner, and another where it "listens" to input signal
    and tries to detect guitar picks for triggering the wah sweep synchronously with
    guitar picking. The pick
    detection works best if the wah receives unaltered input signal from the guitar,
    rather than say distorted input from the overdrive effect.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=distort>Distortion</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt>distort</dt><dd>power of effect</dd>

<dt>saturation</dt><dd>high-frequency "sand" in the sound</dd>
<dt>lowpass</dt><dd>lowpass filter that can be used to change the sound feel</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=delay>Delay</a></h2>
<p>
A no-frills time-delay effect that can also split original signal in several
physical output channels if available.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>decay</dt><dd>decay % between subsequent repeats</dd>
<dt>time</dt><dd>delay time between repeats</dd>
<dt>repeat</dt><dd>number of repeats</dd>
<dt>multichannel</dt><dd>(if available) switch effect to circulate delay voices through available channels</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=reverb>Reverberator</a></h2>
<p>
Reverberator produces echoed "space" sound. Controls:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>delay</dt><dd>delay before repeating starts</dd>
<dt>wet</dt><dd>"wet" (processed) sound volume</dd>
<dt>dry</dt><dd>"dry" (clean) sound volume</dd>
<dt>regen</dt><dd>decay % between subsequent repeats</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=tremolo>Tremolo</a></h2>
<p>
Tremolo is a pitch shifter that does not preserve note relationships (in other words,
a bit like a genuine tremolo bar). This effect is really a version of Stereo phaser
with Wet at 100 % and only one channel used for output.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>period</dt><dd>length of one cycle of effect</dd>
<dt>amplitude</dt><dd>depth of modulation</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=chorus>Chorus / Flanger</a></h2>
<p>
This effect mixes a time-delayed versions of input with the original signal
simulating several players playing the same tune. Variations of this
concept also produce flanger and vibrato effects.
</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong>Use several voices and long base delay time.</p>
<p><strong>Flanger</strong>With just 1 voice and low delay time, the effect becomes a
flanger. However, by adding more voices and increasing the delay, the sound again
turns choruslike. If the multichannel mode is available and enabled, the effect
distributes one voice per output channel.
</p>
<p><strong>Vibrato</strong> If dry/wet at 100% (fully wet) and 1 voice, this effect
is a vibrato.
</p>
<dl>

<dt>depth</dt><dd>the depth of modulation</dd>
<dt>period</dt><dd>the length of modulation cycle</dd>

<dt>dry/wet</dt><dd>dry vs. wet mixing ratio</dd>
<dt>regen</dt><dd>feedbacks some of the output back to input</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=echo>Echo</a></h2>

<p>
Another reverberation effect, but not like the others.  Echo simulates a
large hall echo using varying length of delays in all its voices, and produces
complicated echo pattern that simulates large hall full of hard surfaces of different
sizes.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>decay</dt>
<dd>decay % between subsequent repeats</dd>
<dt>voices</dt>
<dd>number of independent echo voices</dd>
<dt>delay</dt>
<dd>sets the length of maximum echo delay</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=phaser>Phaser</a></h2>

<p>
Phaser operates by introducing a variable frequency dependant delay over the audio
signal. If the dry/wet ratio is at 50 %, the delayed components will produce interference
with the original signal which produces moving notches across the audio spectrum,
producing the phaser sound. However, if dry/wet ratio is at 100%, this effect becomes 
a vibrato.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>period</dt>
<dd>length of the modulation cycle</dd>
<dt>depth</dt>
<dd>an unitless measure of the maximum delay imposed by the effect on the audio</dd>
<dt>dry/wet</dt>
<dd>the dry vs. wet mixing ratio</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=rotary>Rotary speaker</a></h2>

<p>
Rotary speaker is an implementation of the combined horn and bass speaker mounted on
opposite sides of a rotating cabinet. As the cabinet turns, the doppler effect shifts
the audio spectrum up and down, depending on whether the speaker is receding or
approaching.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>period</dt>
<dd>Time for one complete rotation of the cabinet.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=vibrato>Vibrato</a></h2>
<p>
Slows down and speeds up playback to achieve an effect like old tape. This is
done by time-delaying the playback in a long sinuous curve.
</p>
<ul>
<li>period    - length of one cycle of effect</li>
<li>amplitude - maximum time delay</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name=distort2>Overdrive</a></h2>

<p>Another cool distortion. Emulates the distortion circuits in many popular
overdrive pedals such as Ibanez TS9.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>drive</dt><dd>how much amplification</dd>
<dt>clip</dt><dd>changes tone from TS9-type fuzz to less powerful distortion</dd>
<dt>treble</dt><dd>tone control</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=tubeamp>Tube amplifier</a></h2>

<p>
Because Overdrive is limited to simulating the Ibanez TS9, another effect is required
for more powerful distortion sounds.
The effect loosely models a tube amplifier with a variable number of output stages,
each which add different kind of clipping to the sound. Some tone controls are provided
for additional flexibility.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>stages</dt>
<dd>Number of stages. All can be used to produce distortion, 5 stages being very close
to overkill.</dd>
<dt>gain</dt>
<dd>Gain per stage. Higher gains drive the later stages into more clipping.</dd>
<dt>bass cut</dt>
<dd>A highpass filter with tunable cutoff frequency. Increasing this value reduces
   bass from the output.</dd>
<dt>middle cut</dt>
<dd>Decreasing the value of the control introduces a deepening notch at 720 Hz, allowing
   the effect to be used for dark distortion sounds.</dd>
<dt>treble cut</dt>
<dd>A lowpass filter with tunable cutoff frequency. This can be used to change the
   tone and control noise.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name=noise>Noise gate</a></h2>

<p>Simple noise reduction effect.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT NOTES</h3>

<ul>
<li>Should be used <b>BEFORE</b> the distortion.</li>
<li>If you want to achieve a note slight attack (fade in),
    you must increase the Hold time as much as possible.
    Otherwise with the low Attack time and low signal you
    the effect will be constantly false triggered, therefore
    breaking the fade-in effect</li>
</ul>

<p>Controls are:</p>
<ul>
<li>threshold    - minimal volume of the sound required to pass signal
                   to the output.</li>
<li>hold         - if the signal is below threshold during this time,
                   it will be muted. Should be as low as possible.
		   Simply - it is an effect triggering time.</li>
<li>release time - if the signal is below threshold, the playback
                   is not muted immediately but fades out this time instead</li>
<li>attack       - if the signal is above the threshold, it will fade in
                   this time. Usually should be 0, but having it
		   non-zero will produce interesting effect just like the
		   violin sound.</li>
<li>hysteresis   - the threshold required to turn off the playback when
                   it is already on (the regular threshold affects
		   only the growing signal, while hysteresis
		   affects fading signal). Should not be made larger than
		   the threshold value.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="eqbank">Equalizer bank</a></h2>

<p>
A no-frills equalizer effect with plenty of sliders for fine grained
control of the frequency response. Equalizers are rumoured to be especially
useful before and after distortion effects.
</p>

<h2><a name=pitch>Pitch shifter</a></h2>

<p>Pitch shifter alters audible pitch by dividing the input into several small
buffers and playing through them in a different rate, causing the pitch
alteration. Because rate shifting implies generating new sample data or
omitting some of the sample data, there is a discontinuity problem at buffer
edges which is handled through weighting the buffer data with windowing
function and overlapping the buffers in such a way that sample amplitude
remains fairly constant.  </p>

<p><strong>Bugs</strong> With many pitch shifting values several frequencies
encounter difficult phase cancellation that may render some notes almost
inaudible or significantly alter their characteristics. Additionally, as the
new sample data is "generated" from audio data across several hundred
milliseconds, there will be echo effects when adjusting the rate upwards.
Finally, the dry signal is delayed by this effect to control some of the phase
cancellation during wet/dry mixing phase. The latency introduced depends
on the amount of rate shifting.  </p>

</dl>
<h2><a name=tuner>Tuner</a></h2>

<p>
This is a simple general-purpose instrument tuner. The display contains:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the current detected frequency of the sound</li>
<li>the ideal frequency of the sound</li>
<li>the note closest to the measured frequency</li>
<li>an indicator that shows how the two frequencies are matched</li>
<li>list of typical guitar tunings, and indicators that light up when
    frequency matches their pretabulated frequencies.</li>
</ul>

<b>How to tune</b>

<p>In nutshell: if the indicator veers to left, tune up; if it veers to right, tune down.</p>

<p>
Tuner is generally agnostic to the desired tuning. Some indicators are provided
that match some of the most typical guitar tunings, but whether you use them
or not is up to you.
</p>

<b>Tricks and tips</b>

<p> Tuner is very sensitive to noise (unfortunately), so a good, clean signal
is the most important thing.  If tuner doesn't quite seem to work for you out
of the box, try the following tricks: </p>

<ul>
<li>
    Mute all other strings <em>lightly</em> with your fingers. Don't press
    or bend the strings, if you have a floating bridge&mdash;this will
    have similar effect as pressing tremolo bar down.
</li>
<li>
    Pick the string normally above the pickups. The tuner tends to find the
    frequency component with the most amplitude. If you pick the strings in an unusual
    way, it may find some high-order harmonics instead (or even worse,
    oscillate between some upper harmonic and the base frequency).
</li>
<li>
    Try different pickups if tuner has difficulties with particular pickups.
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use the tuner to fix your guitar's intonation (the length of
the string). You may need to check intonation whenever you change your string
make or gauge. First, tune your guitar as perfectly as possible, then pick all
the strings at the 12th fret.  You should see the tuner report double the
frequency but the accuracy indicator should stay centered. Compare this
frequency with the harmonic 12th frequency -- they should be the same.
However, if the indicator of fretted 12th is right to the harmonic, you need to
make the string longer. If it is to left, you need to make the string shorter.
As a general guideline, the thinnest strings are the shortest, and the thickest
strings the longest.</p>
