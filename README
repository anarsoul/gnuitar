				GNUitar
			Guitar processor software

GNUitar is a real-time sound effects software that allows 
you to use your Linux box as guitar processor. It's has GTK+ based 
interface.

Program is based on 2 works:
    o Ele 0.1 by Morris Slutsky
      http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mslutsky/elepage/index.html
    o Guitar FX Processor by Marin Vlah
      http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~mvlah/fx_processor.html

Most part of effects were shamelessly stolen from these programs
and wrapped into GUI widgets. Distortion was taken from ELE and 
improved by great Me, enjoy you guys :)

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need
    o GTK+ version 1.2.6 or fresher
    o full-duplex sound card

Program works fine on my Pentium II/433.
It was tested only on single computer, volunteers for extended tests ?

gnuitar executable file should have suid bit to process sound with 
real-time priority; otherwise you'll hear glitches and delays while 
switching between windows.
 
See INSTALL file for common installation notes. I'm too lazy to 
write my own one.


FEATURES
~~~~~~~~

You can write track of what you play to a file. Just click
check-box "Write track" at the bottom of program window, enter 
filename and play. Don't forget that continuous track write 
can overfill your hard drive.
The track file format is raw data, word length, signed,
48000 Hz sampling rate, 1 channel. You can convert it with 
SoX program like this

    sox -w -s -c 1 -r 48000 track.raw track.wav, 

and then to MP3:

    bladeenc track.wav

Sox is available at http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/sox.html, 
and Bladeenc is at http://home8.swipnet.se/~w-82625.


			    ATTENTION !

NO WARRANTY ! USE ON YOUR OWN RISK !

All file writes can't overwrite existing files.
