1. What is GNUitar ?

GNUitar is a real-time sound effects software that allows 
you to use your computer as a guitar processor. It has GTK+ based 
interface. It can be compiled on any flavor of UNIX that have
GTK+ 1.2, Glib, pthreads and OSS sound driver. It also works on Windows.

Program is based on 2 works:
    o Ele 0.1 by Morris Slutsky
      http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mslutsky/elepage/index.html
    o Guitar FX Processor by Marin Vlah

3. Requirements

You will need
    o GTK+ version 1.2.6 or better; program was not tested with GTK 2.0;
    o GLIB 1.2 or better
    o POSIX threads on UNIX
    o full-duplex sound card
    o GCC on UNIX, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 on Windows


4. Performance

The bottleneck of the real-time sound software is CPU, and quality
of sound driver (the latter also is very depend on OS).
It was reported that GNUitar works pretty well on Celeron II/300.
Pentium/166 is not sufficient to run GNUitar.
Please send your reports with 

4.1 UNIX notes

GNUitar executable file should be setuid root to process sound with 
real-time priority; otherwise you'll hear glitches and delays while 
switching between windows. It switches to real user id as soon as 
it set real-time priority to effect-processing thread, and before
any GTK initializations are being performed, so it shouldn't break 
security on your system.

4.2. Windows notes

Windows have hard problems with latency when processing audio in real time.
This causes GNUitar to perform bad on Windows. I never succeed to reduce
latency lower than 60ms. These are few performance notes:
- close all unnecessary applications before you launch GNUitar;
- try to re-launch it few times, if the initial latency is bad;
- make sure you have the latest driver for your soundcard;
 
See INSTALL file for common installation notes.


5. Usage

The meanings of controls are quite straightforward.

The right area contains available effects. The central area
indicates currently used effects. The buttons right to it should be
used to add/remove effects and change its order.
Each effect has separate control window with appropriate controls.

The left area contains available effect layouts, and button
to add the one. Layout is a "snapshot" of your effects and its' 
settings, that you can load/save using "File" menu.

Big "Switch" button is used to switch layouts. In this manner,
you can change current sound by one mouse/keyboard click.

You can write track of what you play to a file. Just click
check-box "Write track" at the bottom of program window, enter 
filename and play. Don't forget that continuous track write 
can fill out your hard drive.
The track file format is raw data, word length, signed,
44100 Hz sampling rate, 1 channel. In future, sampling format may change,
however you will always be informed about actual format.
You can convert it with SoX program like this

    sox -w -s -c 1 -r 44100 track.raw track.wav, 

and then to MP3:

    bladeenc track.wav

Sox is available at http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/sox.html, 
and Bladeenc is at http://home8.swipnet.se/~w-82625.

Windows users can write track directly to .wav file
(currently it is not available on UNIX).


6. Bugs

Probably they are there :-) Send bug reports to fonin@ziet.zhitomir.ua


7. About Free Software Development

You should always keep in mind, that development of free software
doesn't work in the same way as commercial development. Every
successful free software project has an active userbase behind it. This
means that your comments, ideas and bug reports are extremely
important. If something doesn't work, or some feature is missing,
please mail me about it. Thank you in advance! You can send GNUitar
related mails to me at mailto:fonin@ziet.zhitomir.ua.
