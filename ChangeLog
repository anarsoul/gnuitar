	* Fixed closing main window. There was a bug - after close 
	application still was in memory.

	* Removed "Clip" function from distortion. I found it ambiguous and 
	  unelegant.
	* Make effect control windows ignore "delete_event", to prevent 
	  accidentally close.
	* Bank clist widget width auto-resizing
	* Few entries in TODO
	* Added section "BUGS" to README
	* Program does setuid(real user id) immediately after setting 
	  real time priority to pumper thread. All open(...,O_CREAT | O_EXCL) 
	  (file open error if the file already exists) through the code 
	  replaced with simply O_CREAT (file will be overwritten).
